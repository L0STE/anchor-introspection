# Anchor i11n

A set of helper macros that allows for more idiomatic usage of Instruction Introspection (i11n) with Anchor programs. 

# What can you do with this?

Ever tried to use Instruction Introspection only to be confronted with a random array of bytes and accounts, forcing you to go and roll your own de/serialization or keep another tab open to look up the account indexes? No more!

# Why i11n?

For whatever reason, I often make typos writing the word introspection. Calling it i11n solves this problem for me. Hope that helps.
